# Custom Hooks #

- The best way to create resuable code in a react project (besides component!)
- Created by extracting hook-related code out of a function component.
- Custom hooks always make use of at-least one primitive hook internally.
- Each custom hook should have one purpose.
- Kind of an art form!
- Data-fetching is a great thing to try to make reusable.
